# Hand Gesture Recognition
By Visheshank Mishra and Talal Siddiqui 

This is our final project for CS5100: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University.

Our project focused on the topic of hand gesture recognition.

## Running

To run, please run the `webcam_predictor.py` file and allow the program to access your webcam. Then,
make a gesture in the green box in the top left corner.

Here are the following gestures and their numeric value (which is what you see on the program)
 - 1 = Palm
 - 2 = L
 - 3 = Fist
 - 4 = Fist at an angle
 - 5 = Thumb
 - 6 = Index finger
 - 7 = OK sign
 - 8 = Palm at an angle
 - 9 = C (made using index and thumb)
 - 10 = Fingers pointing down
